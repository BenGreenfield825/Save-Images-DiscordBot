# Save Images with a DiscordBot
 A simple bot that shows how to save an image from discord chat 
 
 ## Usage
 When uploading an image to discord, add ```.save``` in the comment box to tell the bot to save the image.\
 **This program does not check for having multiple images.**\
 **_This will not check to make sure the attachment is actually an image!!! This is a possible security issue - be careful!_**
 
 ### Info
 I'm currently working on a project where I wanted to be able to have a bot save an image from chat and do some processing to it (Object-Detection). I couldn't find any great examples that showed how to do this (especially in python), but I managed to find a simple example from stackoverflow that I fixed up and edited (shout out and original credit goes to here -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55886443/bot-saving-every-image-gif-or-video-sent-in-a-specific-channel-on-discord).
 
 A lot of this was new to me also, so I added some comments giving quick descriptions of what was happening as I learned. Hopefully this helps out anyone else who is interested like I was. 
 
 I now also have a YouTube video on this topic! Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgmUBOV3IIs
